# HuffmanEncoder
A program that performs Huffman coding and compression on files by reading a byte at a time and interpreting the bytes as ints. Utilizes tools such as BufferedInput/Output streams, maps, priority queues and recursion. Compresses/uncompresses both SCF (Standard Count Format) and STF (Standard Tree Format) type huffman files.
